# MyReads
A personal database system to track *my reads*.

## Description
**MyReads** is an application to manage all aspects of my reading
- Books I want to read and their details
- The source of the book and available formats
- The method I want to use to read the book
- Reading history
- Personal annotations (highlights, notes, summaries)
- Next read recommendation engine

I chose to build my own application instead of using something already existing because nothing currently available fits all of my needs or has a public API.
